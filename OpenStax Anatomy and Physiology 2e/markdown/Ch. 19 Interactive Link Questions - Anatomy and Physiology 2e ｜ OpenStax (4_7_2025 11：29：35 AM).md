Visit this [site](http://openstax.org/l/heartvalve) to observe an
echocardiogram of actual heart valves opening and closing. Although much of
the heart has been “removed” from this gif loop so the chordae tendineae are
not visible, why is their presence more critical for the atrioventricular
valves (tricuspid and mitral) than the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary)
valves?
