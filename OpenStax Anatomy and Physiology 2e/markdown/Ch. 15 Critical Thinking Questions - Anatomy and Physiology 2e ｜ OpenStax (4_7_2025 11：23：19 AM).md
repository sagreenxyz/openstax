In the context of a lioness hunting on the savannah, why would the sympathetic
system _not_ activate the digestive system?

28. 

A target effector, such as the heart, receives input from the sympathetic and
parasympathetic systems. What is the actual difference between the sympathetic
and parasympathetic divisions at the level of those connections (i.e., at the
synapse)?

29. 

Damage to internal organs will present as pain associated with a particular
surface area of the body. Why would something like irritation to the
diaphragm, which is between the thoracic and abdominal cavities, feel like
pain in the shoulder or neck?

30. 

Medical practice is paying more attention to the autonomic system in
considering disease states. Why would autonomic tone be important in
considering cardiovascular disease?

31. 

Hornerâ€™s syndrome is a condition that presents with changes in one eye, such
as pupillary constriction and dropping of eyelids, as well as decreased
sweating in the face. Why could a tumor in the thoracic cavity have an effect
on these autonomic functions?

32. 

The cardiovascular center is responsible for regulating the heart and blood
vessels through homeostatic mechanisms. What tone does each component of the
cardiovascular system have? What connections does the cardiovascular center
invoke to keep these two systems in their resting tone?

33. 

Why does smoking increase the risk of heart disease? Provide two reasons based
on autonomic function.

34. 

Why might topical, cosmetic application of atropine or scopolamine from the
belladonna plant not cause fatal poisoning, as would occur with ingestion of
the plant?
