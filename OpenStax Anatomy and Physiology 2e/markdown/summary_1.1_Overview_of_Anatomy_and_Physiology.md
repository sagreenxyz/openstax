## Summary of 1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology

### Key Points:

- **Definition of Anatomy**: The scientific study of the bodyâ€™s structures, ranging from microscopic to macroscopic levels.
- **Origins of Anatomy**: Initially studied through external observation and injuries, later advanced through dissection and modern imaging techniques.
- **Specializations in Anatomy**:
  - **Gross Anatomy (Macroscopic Anatomy)**: Study of larger structures visible without magnification.
  - **Microscopic Anatomy**: Study of smaller structures requiring magnification, including:
    - **Cytology**: Study of cells.
    - **Histology**: Study of tissues.
- **Advancements in Technology**: Improved microscopes have enabled the study of increasingly smaller structures, from organs to molecular levels.

### Applications:
- Dissection remains a key method in medical education and pathology.
- Imaging techniques allow for the observation of internal structures in living bodies, aiding in diagnosis and treatment.
