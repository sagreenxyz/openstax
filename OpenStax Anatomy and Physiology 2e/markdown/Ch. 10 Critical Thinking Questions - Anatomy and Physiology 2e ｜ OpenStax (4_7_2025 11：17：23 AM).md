Why is elasticity an important quality of muscle tissue?

31. 

What would happen to skeletal muscle if the epimysium were destroyed?

32. 

Describe how tendons facilitate body movement.

33. 

What are the five primary functions of skeletal muscle?

34. 

What are the opposite roles of voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage-gated
potassium channels?

35. 

How would muscle contractions be affected if skeletal muscle fibers did not
have T-tubules?

36. 

What causes the striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue?

37. 

How would muscle contractions be affected if ATP was completely depleted in a
muscle fiber?

38. 

Why does a motor unit of the eye have few muscle fibers compared to a motor
unit of the leg?

39. 

What factors contribute to the amount of tension produced in an individual
muscle fiber?

40. 

Why do muscle cells use creatine phosphate instead of glycolysis to supply ATP
for the first few seconds of muscle contraction?

41. 

Is aerobic respiration more or less efficient than glycolysis? Explain your
answer.

42. 

What changes occur at the cellular level in response to endurance training?

43. 

What changes occur at the cellular level in response to resistance training?

44. 

What would be the drawback of cardiac contractions being the same duration as
skeletal muscle contractions?

45. 

How are cardiac muscle cells similar to and different from skeletal muscle
cells?

46. 

Why can smooth muscles contract over a wider range of resting lengths than
skeletal and cardiac muscle?

47. 

Describe the differences between single-unit smooth muscle and multiunit
smooth muscle.

48. 

Why is muscle that has sustained significant damage unable to produce the same
amount of power as it could before being damaged?

49. 

Which muscle type(s) (skeletal, smooth, or cardiac) can regenerate new muscle
cells/fibers? Explain your answer.
