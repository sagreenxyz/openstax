## Summary of 6.6 Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue

### Key Points:

- **Exercise**:
  - Mechanical stress strengthens bones by stimulating mineral deposition and collagen production.
  - Resistance training is more effective than cardiovascular activities for bone density.
  - Lack of stress (e.g., in space) leads to bone loss.

- **Nutrition**:
  - **Calcium**: Critical for bone structure; obtained from dairy, leafy greens, and fish.
  - **Vitamin D**: Essential for calcium absorption; synthesized via sunlight or obtained from fortified foods.

- **Hormones**:
  - Regulate bone growth and remodeling.
  - Examples: Growth hormone, sex hormones, and parathyroid hormone.
