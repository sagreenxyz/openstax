28. 

Arterioles are often referred to as resistance vessels. Why?

29. 

Cocaine use causes vasoconstriction. Is this likely to increase or decrease
blood pressure, and why?

30. 

A blood vessel with a few smooth muscle fibers and connective tissue, and only
a very thin tunica externa conducts blood toward the heart. What type of
vessel is this?

31. 

You measure a patient’s blood pressure at 130/85. Calculate the patient’s
pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure. Determine whether each pressure is
low, normal, or high.

32. 

An obese patient comes to the clinic complaining of swollen feet and ankles,
fatigue, shortness of breath, and often feeling “spaced out.” She is a cashier
in a grocery store, a job that requires her to stand all day. Outside of work,
she engages in no physical activity. She confesses that, because of her
weight, she finds even walking uncomfortable. Explain how the skeletal muscle
pump might play a role in this patient’s signs and symptoms.

33. 

A patient arrives at the emergency department with dangerously low blood
pressure. The patient’s blood colloid osmotic pressure is normal. How would
you expect this situation to affect the patient’s net filtration pressure?

34. 

True or false? The plasma proteins suspended in blood cross the capillary cell
membrane and enter the tissue fluid via facilitated diffusion. Explain your
thinking.

35. 

A patient arrives in the emergency department with a blood pressure of 70/45
confused and complaining of thirst. Why?

36. 

Nitric oxide is broken down very quickly after its release. Why?

37. 

Identify the ventricle of the heart that pumps oxygen-depleted blood and the
arteries of the body that carry oxygen-depleted blood.

38. 

What organs do the gonadal veins drain?

39. 

What arteries play the leading roles in supplying blood to the brain?

40. 

All tissues, including malignant tumors, need a blood supply. Explain why
drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors would be used in cancer treatment.

41. 

Explain the location and importance of the ductus arteriosus in fetal
circulation.
