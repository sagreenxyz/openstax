1. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/skull1) to view a rotating and
exploded skull with color-coded bones. Which bone (yellow) is centrally
located and joins with most of the other bones of the skull?

2. 

View this [animation](http://openstax.org/l/headblow) to see how a blow to the
head may produce a contrecoup (counterblow) fracture of the basilar portion of
the occipital bone on the base of the skull. Why may a basilar fracture be
life threatening?

3. 

Osteoporosis is a common age-related bone disease in which bone density and
strength is decreased. Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/osteoporosis)
to get a better understanding of how thoracic vertebrae may become weakened
and may fractured due to this disease. How may vertebral osteoporosis
contribute to kyphosis?

4. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/herndisc1) to learn about a herniated
disc. Watch this second [video](http://openstax.org/l/herndisc2) to see one
possible treatment for a herniated disc, removing the damaged portion of the
disc. How could lifting a heavy object produce pain in a lower limb?

5. 

Use this [tool](http://openstax.org/l/vertcolumn) to identify the bones,
intervertebral discs, and ligaments of the vertebral column. The thickest
portions of the anterior longitudinal ligament and the supraspinous ligament
are found in which regions of the vertebral column?

6. 

View this [video](http://openstax.org/l/skullbones) to review the two
processes that give rise to the bones of the skull and body. What are the two
mechanisms by which the bones of the body are formed and which bones are
formed by each mechanism?
