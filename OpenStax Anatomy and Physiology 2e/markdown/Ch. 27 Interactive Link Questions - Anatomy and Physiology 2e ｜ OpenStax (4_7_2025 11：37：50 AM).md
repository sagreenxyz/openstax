1. 

Watch this [_video_](http://openstax.org/l/vasectomy) to learn about
vasectomy. As described in this video, a vasectomy is a procedure in which a
small section of the ductus (vas) deferens is removed from the scrotum. This
interrupts the path taken by sperm through the ductus deferens. If sperm do
not exit through the vas, either because the person has had a vasectomy or has
not ejaculated, in what region of the testis do they remain?

2. 

Watch this [ _video_](http://openstax.org/l/spermpath) to explore the
structures of the male reproductive system and the path of sperm that starts
in the testes and ends as the sperm leave the penis through the urethra. Where
are sperm deposited after they leave the ejaculatory duct?

3. 

Watch this [ _video_](http://openstax.org/l/ovulation) to observe ovulation
and its initiation in response to the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary
gland. What specialized structures help guide the oocyte from the ovary into
the uterine tube?

4. 

Watch this [ _video_](http://openstax.org/l/oocyte) to look at the movement of
the oocyte through the ovary. The cilia in the uterine tube promote movement
of the oocyte. What would likely occur if the cilia were paralyzed at the time
of ovulation?

5. 

The different genitalia of fetuses develop from the same tissues in the
embryo. View this [ _animation_](http://openstax.org/l/fetus) that compares
the development of structures of the female and male reproductive systems in a
growing fetus. Where are the testes located for most of gestational time?
