## Summary of 1.3 Functions of Human Life

### Key Points:

- **Organization**: The human body is organized into compartments to protect cells and maintain internal environments. Examples include:
  - **Cell Membrane**: Separates intracellular and extracellular environments.
  - **Blood Vessels**: Keep blood within a closed circulatory system.
  - **Integumentary System**: Protects internal structures with skin, hair, and nails.
- **Metabolism**: Involves energy transformation through:
  - **Anabolism**: Building larger molecules from smaller ones, consuming energy.
  - **Catabolism**: Breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy.
  - **ATP**: Stores and releases energy for cellular activities.
- **Responsiveness**: The ability to adjust to internal and external changes, such as:
  - Moving toward food and water.
  - Sweating to regulate body temperature.
- **Movement**: Includes:
  - Voluntary actions like walking.
  - Involuntary actions like blood circulation and digestion.

### Applications:
- Understanding these functions helps explain how the body maintains homeostasis and supports life processes.
