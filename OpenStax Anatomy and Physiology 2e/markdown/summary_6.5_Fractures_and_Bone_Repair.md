## Summary of 6.5 Fractures: Bone Repair

### Key Points:

- **Fractures**:
  - A break in a bone; classified by complexity, location, and features.
  - Types include closed, open, transverse, spiral, comminuted, impacted, and greenstick.

- **Bone Repair Process**:
  1. **Hematoma Formation**: Blood clot forms at the fracture site.
  2. **Callus Formation**: Fibrocartilaginous callus stabilizes the fracture.
  3. **Bony Callus Formation**: Osteoblasts replace cartilage with bone.
  4. **Bone Remodeling**: Compact bone replaces spongy bone; restores shape and strength.
