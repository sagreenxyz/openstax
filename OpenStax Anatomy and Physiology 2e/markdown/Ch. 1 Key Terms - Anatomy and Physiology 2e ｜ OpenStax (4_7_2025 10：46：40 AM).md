metabolism

    sum of all of the body’s chemical reactions

microscopic anatomy

    study of very small structures of the body using magnification

negative feedback

    homeostatic mechanism that tends to stabilize an upset in the body’s physiological condition by preventing an excessive response to a stimulus, typically as the stimulus is removed

normal range

    range of values around the set point that do not cause a reaction by the control center

nutrient

    chemical obtained from foods and beverages that is critical to human survival

organ

    functionally distinct structure composed of two or more types of tissues

organ system

    group of organs that work together to carry out a particular function

organism

    living being that has a cellular structure and that can independently perform all physiologic functions necessary for life

pericardium

    sac that encloses the heart

peritoneum

    serous membrane that lines the abdominopelvic cavity and covers the organs found there

physiology

    science that studies the chemistry, biochemistry, and physics of the body’s functions

plane

    imaginary two-dimensional surface that passes through the body

pleura

    serous membrane that lines the pleural cavity and covers the lungs

positive feedback

    mechanism that intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition in response to a stimulus

positron emission tomography (PET)

    medical imaging technique in which radiopharmaceuticals are traced to reveal metabolic and physiological functions in tissues

    describes the back or direction toward the back of the body; also referred to as dorsal

posterior cavity

    posterior body cavity that houses the brain and spinal cord; also referred to as dorsal cavity

pressure

    force exerted by a substance in contact with another substance

prone

    face down

proximal

    describes a position nearer to the point of attachment or the trunk of the body

regional anatomy

    study of the structures that contribute to specific body regions

renewal

    process by which worn-out cells are replaced

reproduction

    process by which new organisms are generated

responsiveness

    ability of an organisms or a system to adjust to changes in conditions

sagittal plane

    two-dimensional, vertical plane that divides the body or organ into right and left sides

section

    in anatomy, a single flat surface of a three-dimensional structure that has been cut through
