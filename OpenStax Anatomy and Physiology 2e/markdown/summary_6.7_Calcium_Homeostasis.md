## Summary of 6.7 Calcium Homeostasis

### Key Points:

- **Importance of Calcium**:
  - Most abundant mineral in the body.
  - Essential for:
    - Bone mineralization.
    - Tooth health.
    - Heart rate regulation.
    - Muscle contraction.
    - Nerve impulse conduction.

- **Calcium Levels**:
  - Normal blood calcium level: ~10 mg/dL.
  - Imbalances:
    - **Hypocalcemia**: Low calcium levels; affects circulation, muscles, nerves, and bones.
    - **Hypercalcemia**: High calcium levels; causes lethargy, confusion, and severe cases of coma.

- **Regulation Mechanisms**:
  - **Calcitonin** (thyroid gland): Lowers calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts and reducing kidney reabsorption.
  - **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)**: Increases calcium levels by stimulating osteoclasts, kidney reabsorption, and intestinal absorption via Vitamin D.
