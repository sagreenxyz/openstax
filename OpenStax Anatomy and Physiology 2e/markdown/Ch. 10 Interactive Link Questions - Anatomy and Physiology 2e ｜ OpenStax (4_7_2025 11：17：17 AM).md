1. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/micromacro) to learn more about
macro- and microstructures of skeletal muscles. (a) What are the names of the
“junction points” between sarcomeres? (b) What are the names of the “subunits”
within the myofibrils that run the length of skeletal muscle fibers? (c) What
is the “double strand of pearls” described in the video? (d) What gives a
skeletal muscle fiber its striated appearance?

2. 

Every skeletal muscle fiber is supplied by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Watch
this [video](http://openstax.org/l/skelmuscfiber) to learn more about what
happens at the neuromuscular junction. (a) What is the definition of a motor
unit? (b) What is the structural and functional difference between a large
motor unit and a small motor unit? Can you give an example of each? (c) Why is
the neurotransmitter acetylcholine degraded after binding to its receptor?

3. 

The release of calcium ions initiates muscle contractions. Watch this
[video](http://openstax.org/l/calciumrole) to learn more about the role of
calcium. (a) What are “T-tubules” and what is their role? (b) Please also
describe how actin-binding sites are made available for cross-bridging with
myosin heads during contraction.
