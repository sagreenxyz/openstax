juxtamedullary nephrons

    nephrons adjacent to the border of the cortex and medulla with loops of Henle that extend into the renal medulla

leaky tight junctions

    tight junctions in which the sealing strands of proteins between the membranes of adjacent cells are fewer in number and incomplete; allows limited intercellular movement of solvent and solutes

leukocyte esterase

    enzyme produced by leukocytes that can be detected in the urine and that serves as an indirect indicator of urinary tract infection

loop of Henle

    descending and ascending portions between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules; those of cortical nephrons do not extend into the medulla, whereas those of juxtamedullary nephrons do extend into the medulla

macula densa

    cells found in the part of the DCT forming the JGA; sense Na+ concentration in the forming urine

medulla

    inner region of kidney containing the renal pyramids

mesangial

    contractile cells found in the glomerulus; can contract or relax to regulate filtration rate

micturition

    also called urination or voiding

myogenic mechanism

    mechanism by which smooth muscle responds to stretch by contracting; an increase in blood pressure causes vasoconstriction and a decrease in blood pressure causes vasodilation so that blood flow downstream remains steady

nephrons

    functional units of the kidney that carry out all filtration and modification to produce urine; consist of renal corpuscles, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and descending and ascending loops of Henle; drain into collecting ducts

net filtration pressure (NFP)

     pressure of fluid across the glomerulus; calculated by taking the hydrostatic pressure of the capillary and subtracting the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood and the hydrostatic pressure of Bowman’s capsule

oliguria

    below normal urine production of 400–500 mL/day

osteomalacia

    softening of bones due to a lack of mineralization with calcium and phosphate; most often due to lack of vitamin D; in children, osteomalacia is termed rickets; not to be confused with osteoporosis

physiological sphincter

    sphincter consisting of circular smooth muscle indistinguishable from adjacent muscle but possessing differential innervations, permitting its function as a sphincter; structurally weak

podocytes

    cells forming finger-like processes; form the visceral layer of Bowman’s capsule; pedicels of the podocytes interdigitate to form a filtration membrane

sacral micturition center

    group of neurons in the sacral region of the spinal cord that controls urination; acts reflexively unless its action is modified by higher brain centers to allow voluntary urination

specific gravity

    weight of a liquid compared to pure water, which has a specific gravity of 1.0; any solute added to water will increase its specific gravity
