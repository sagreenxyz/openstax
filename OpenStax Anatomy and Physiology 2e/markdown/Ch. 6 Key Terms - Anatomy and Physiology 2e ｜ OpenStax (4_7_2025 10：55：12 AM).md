    production of blood cells, which occurs in the red marrow of the bones

hole

    opening or depression in a bone

hypercalcemia

    condition characterized by abnormally high levels of calcium

hypocalcemia

    condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium

internal callus

    fibrocartilaginous matrix, in the endosteal region, between the two ends of a broken bone

intramembranous ossification

    process by which bone forms directly from mesenchymal tissue

irregular bone

    bone of complex shape; protects internal organs from compressive forces

lacunae

    (singular = lacuna) spaces in a bone that house an osteocyte

long bone

    cylinder-shaped bone that is longer than it is wide; functions as a lever

medullary cavity

    hollow region of the diaphysis; filled with yellow marrow

modeling

    process, during bone growth, by which bone is resorbed on one surface of a bone and deposited on another

nutrient foramen

    small opening in the middle of the external surface of the diaphysis, through which an artery enters the bone to provide nourishment

open reduction

    surgical exposure of a bone to reset a fracture

orthopedist

    doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal disorders and injuries

osseous tissue

    bone tissue; a hard, dense connective tissue that forms the structural elements of the skeleton

ossification

    (also, osteogenesis) bone formation

ossification center

    cluster of osteoblasts found in the early stages of intramembranous ossification

osteoblast

    cell responsible for forming new bone

osteoclast

    cell responsible for resorbing bone

osteocyte

    primary cell in mature bone; responsible for maintaining the matrix

osteogenic cell

    undifferentiated cell with high mitotic activity; the only bone cells that divide; they differentiate and develop into osteoblasts

osteoid

    uncalcified bone matrix secreted by osteoblasts

osteon

    (also, Haversian system) basic structural unit of compact bone; made of concentric layers of calcified matrix

osteoporosis

    disease characterized by a decrease in bone mass; occurs when the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of bone formation, a common occurrence as the body ages

perforating canal

    (also, Volkmann’s canal) channel that branches off from the central canal and houses vessels and nerves that extend to the periosteum and endosteum

perichondrium

    membrane that covers cartilage

periosteum

    fibrous membrane covering the outer surface of bone and continuous with ligaments

primary ossification center

    region, deep in the periosteal collar, where bone development starts during endochondral ossification

projection

    bone markings where part of the surface sticks out above the rest of the surface, where tendons and ligaments attach

proliferative zone

    region of the epiphyseal plate that makes new chondrocytes to replace those that die at the diaphyseal end of the plate and contributes to longitudinal growth of the epiphyseal plate

red marrow

    connective tissue in the interior cavity of a bone where hematopoiesis takes place

remodeling

    process by which osteoclasts resorb old or damaged bone at the same time as and on the same surface where osteoblasts form new bone to replace that which is resorbed

reserve zone

    region of the epiphyseal plate that anchors the plate to the osseous tissue of the epiphysis

secondary ossification center

    region of bone development in the epiphyses

sesamoid bone

    small, round bone embedded in a tendon; protects the tendon from compressive forces

short bone

    cube-shaped bone that is approximately equal in length, width, and thickness; provides limited motion

skeletal system

    organ system composed of bones and cartilage that provides for movement, support, and protection

spongy bone

    (also, cancellous bone) trabeculated osseous tissue that supports shifts in weight distribution

trabeculae

    (singular = trabecula) spikes or sections of the lattice-like matrix in spongy bone

yellow marrow

    connective tissue in the interior cavity of a bone where fat is stored

zone of calcified matrix

    region of the epiphyseal plate closest to the diaphyseal end; functions to connect the epiphyseal plate to the diaphysis

zone of maturation and hypertrophy

    region of the epiphyseal plate where chondrocytes from the proliferative zone grow and mature and contribute to the longitudinal growth of the epiphyseal plate
