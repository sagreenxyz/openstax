## Summary of 1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body

### Key Points:

- **Levels of Organization**: The human body is organized into increasing levels of complexity:
  - Subatomic particles → Atoms → Molecules → Organelles → Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems → Organism → Biosphere.
- **Organ Systems**: The human body has eleven organ systems, each with specific organs and functions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Urinary System**: Includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Functions to remove waste and regulate fluid balance.

### Applications:
- Understanding the structural organization helps in studying how smaller components assemble into functional systems.
