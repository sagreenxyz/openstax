Visit this [site](http://openstax.org/l/normallevels) for a list of normal
levels established for many of the substances found in a sample of blood.
Serum, one of the specimen types included, refers to a sample of plasma after
clotting factors have been removed. What types of measurements are given for
levels of glucose in the blood?

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/doping) to see doctors discuss the
dangers of blood doping in sports. What are the some potential side effects of
blood doping?

[Figure 18.13](https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-
physiology-2e/pages/18-4-leukocytes-and-platelets#fig-ch19_04_04) Are you able
to recognize and identify the various formed elements? You will need to do
this is a systematic manner, scanning along the image. The standard method is
to use a grid, but this is not possible with this resource. Try constructing a
simple table with each leukocyte type and then making a mark for each cell
type you identify. Attempt to classify at least 50 and perhaps as many as 100
different cells. Based on the percentage of cells that you count, do the
numbers represent a normal blood smear or does something appear to be
abnormal?

View these [animations](http://openstax.org/l/coagulation) to explore the
intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways that are involved the process of
coagulation. The coagulation cascade restores hemostasis by activating
coagulation factors in the presence of an injury.
