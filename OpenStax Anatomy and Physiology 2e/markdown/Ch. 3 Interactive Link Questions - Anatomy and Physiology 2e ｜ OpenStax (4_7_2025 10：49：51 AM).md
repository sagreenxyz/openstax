Visit this [link](http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it
is propelled by the kinetic energy of molecules in solution. How does
temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?

2. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/endomembrane1) to learn about the
endomembrane system, which includes the rough and smooth ER and the Golgi body
as well as lysosomes and vesicles. What is the primary role of the
endomembrane system?

3. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/DNArep) to learn about DNA
replication. DNA replication proceeds simultaneously at several sites on the
same molecule. What separates the base pair at the start of DNA replication?

4. 

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/ribosome) to learn about ribosomes.
The ribosome binds to the mRNA molecule to start translation of its code into
a protein. What happens to the small and large ribosomal subunits at the end
of translation?

5. 

Visit this [link](http://openstax.org/l/mitosis) to learn about mitosis.
Mitosis results in two identical diploid cells. What structures form during
prophase?
