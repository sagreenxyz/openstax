Visit this [website](http://openstax.org/l/ptable) to view the periodic table.
In the periodic table of the elements, elements in a single column have the
same number of electrons that can participate in a chemical reaction. These
electrons are known as “valence electrons.” For example, the elements in the
first column all have a single valence electron—an electron that can be
“donated” in a chemical reaction with another atom. What is the meaning of a
mass number shown in parentheses?

Visit this [website](http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about
electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of charges. What happens to the
charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets, and
why?

Watch this [video](http://openstax.org/l/disaccharide) to observe the
formation of a disaccharide. What happens when water encounters a glycosidic
bond?
