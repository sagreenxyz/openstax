antidiuretic hormone (ADH)

    also known as vasopressin, a hormone that increases the volume of water reabsorbed from the collecting tubules of the kidney

dehydration

    state of containing insufficient water in blood and other tissues

dihydroxyvitamin D

    active form of vitamin D required by the intestinal epithelial cells for the absorption of calcium

diuresis

    excess production of urine

extracellular fluid (ECF)

    fluid exterior to cells; includes the interstitial fluid, blood plasma, and fluids found in other reservoirs in the body

fluid compartment

    fluid inside all cells of the body constitutes a compartment system that is largely segregated from other systems

hydrostatic pressure

    pressure exerted by a fluid against a wall, caused by its own weight or pumping force

hypercalcemia

    abnormally increased blood levels of calcium

hypercapnia

    abnormally elevated blood levels of CO2

hyperchloremia

    higher-than-normal blood chloride levels

hyperkalemia

    higher-than-normal blood potassium levels

hypernatremia

    abnormal increase in blood sodium levels

hyperphosphatemia

    abnormally increased blood phosphate levels

hypocalcemia

    abnormally low blood levels of calcium

hypocapnia

    abnormally low blood levels of CO2

hypochloremia

    lower-than-normal blood chloride levels

hypokalemia

    abnormally decreased blood levels of potassium

hyponatremia

    lower-than-normal levels of sodium in the blood

interstitial fluid (IF)

    fluid in the small spaces between cells not contained within blood vessels

intracellular fluid (ICF)

    fluid in the cytosol of cells

metabolic acidosis

    condition wherein a deficiency of bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly acidic

metabolic alkalosis

    condition wherein an excess of bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly alkaline

plasma osmolality

    ratio of solutes to a volume of solvent in the plasma; plasma osmolality reflects a personâ€™s state of hydration

respiratory acidosis

    condition wherein an excess of carbonic acid or CO2 causes the blood to be overly acidic

respiratory alkalosis

    condition wherein a deficiency of carbonic acid/CO2 levels causes the blood to be overly alkaline
