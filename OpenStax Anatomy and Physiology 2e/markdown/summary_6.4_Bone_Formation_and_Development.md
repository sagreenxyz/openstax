## Summary of 6.4 Bone Formation and Development

### Key Points:

- **Bone Development**:
  - Begins in the embryo (~6-7 weeks).
  - Two pathways:
    - **Intramembranous Ossification**: Forms flat bones (e.g., skull, clavicles).
    - **Endochondral Ossification**: Replaces cartilage with bone; forms most bones.

- **Cartilage Templates**:
  - Serve as a framework for bone formation.
  - Chondroblasts produce the cartilage matrix.

- **Bone Growth**:
  - Continues during childhood and adolescence.
  - Epiphyseal plates allow for lengthwise growth.
