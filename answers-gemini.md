# Chapter 1: An Introduction to the Human Body

Question 1.6: "Which of the following specialties might focus on studying all of the structures of the ankle and foot?"
Correct Answer: regional anatomy
Explanation: Regional anatomy is the study of the structures within a specific region of the body, such as the ankle and foot. Microscopic anatomy deals with structures too small to be seen without a microscope. Muscle anatomy focuses specifically on muscles. Systemic anatomy studies the body system by system (e.g., the skeletal system, muscular system).
Question 1.7: "A scientist wants to study how the body uses foods and fluids during a marathon run. This scientist is most likely a(n) ________."
Correct Answer: exercise physiologist
Explanation: Exercise physiology studies how the body functions during physical activity, including the utilization of nutrients and fluids. The other options relate to anatomy (the study of structure), not physiology (the study of function), or are too broad (regional physiologist isn't a standard term) or too specific (microscopic anatomist).
Question 1.8: "The smallest independently functioning biological unit of an organism is a(n) ________."
Correct Answer: cell
Explanation: The cell is the fundamental unit of life. Molecules are chemical structures, tissues are groups of similar cells, and organs are structures composed of different tissues working together.
Question 1.9: "A collection of similar tissues that performs a specific function is an ________."
Correct Answer: organ
Explanation: An organ (like the heart, liver, or stomach) is defined as a structure composed of two or more tissue types that work together to perform specific functions. Organelles are structures within a cell. An organism is a complete living being. An organ system is a group of organs working together.
Question 1.10: "The body system responsible for structural support and movement is the ________."
Correct Answer: skeletal system
Explanation: The skeletal system provides the framework (structural support) and, along with the muscular system, enables movement. The muscular system's primary role is generating force for movement. The cardiovascular system transports blood, and the endocrine system regulates processes via hormones.
Question 1.11: "Metabolism can be defined as the ________."
Correct Answer: sum of all chemical reactions in an organism
Explanation: Metabolism encompasses all chemical processes occurring within a living organism to maintain life, including both building up (anabolism) and breaking down (catabolism) substances. The other options describe responsiveness, differentiation, and cell replacement/growth, respectively.
Question 1.12: "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an important molecule because it ________."
Correct Answer: stores energy for use by body cells
Explanation: ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, storing chemical energy in its phosphate bonds that can be released to power cellular activities. While ATP is involved in catabolism (energy-releasing reactions break down molecules to generate ATP) and anabolism (energy-consuming reactions use ATP), its main role is storing readily usable energy. It releases energy in controlled enzymatic reactions, not uncontrolled bursts.
Question 1.13: "Cancer cells can be characterized as “generic” cells that perform no specialized body function. Thus cancer cells lack ________."
Correct Answer: differentiation
Explanation: Differentiation is the process by which cells become specialized. Cancer cells often lose this specialization (dedifferentiate) and revert to a more generic, rapidly dividing state. They are capable of reproduction (uncontrolled division) and responsiveness (to growth signals, for example).
Question 1.14: "Humans have the most urgent need for a continuous supply of ________."
Correct Answer: oxygen
Explanation: While food, water, and nitrogen are essential, humans can only survive for a few minutes without a continuous supply of oxygen, which is required for aerobic respiration to produce ATP efficiently.
Question 1.15: "Which of the following statements about nutrients is true?"
Correct Answer: All classes of nutrients are essential to human survival.
Explanation: Nutrients (water, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals) are all required for survival, although in varying amounts. Macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) are needed in larger quantities; micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) are needed in smaller quantities. Some micronutrients can be stored by the body.
Question 1.16: "C.J. is stuck in their car during a bitterly cold blizzard. Their body responds to the cold by ________."
Correct Answer: breaking down stored energy
Explanation: To generate heat in response to cold, the body increases its metabolic rate, which involves breaking down stored energy (like fat and glycogen) through processes like shivering. Blood flow to extremities (hands and feet) is typically reduced to conserve core heat. Lethargy might occur with prolonged exposure but isn't the primary initial response to generate heat. Blood oxygen levels don't significantly increase as the primary response.
Question 1.17: "After you eat lunch, nerve cells in your stomach respond to the distension (the stimulus) resulting from the food. They relay this information to ________."
Correct Answer: a control center
Explanation: In a feedback loop, sensors (nerve cells detecting distension) send information to a control center (often in the brain or spinal cord), which processes the information and directs a response via effectors. The set point is the target value the system tries to maintain.
Question 1.18: "Stimulation of the heat-loss center causes ________."
Correct Answer: sweat glands to increase their output
Explanation: The heat-loss center (in the hypothalamus) triggers mechanisms to cool the body. These include increasing sweat production (evaporation cools the skin) and dilating (not constricting) blood vessels in the skin to radiate heat. Breathing may become slightly faster, not slower and shallower.
Question 1.19: "Which of the following is an example of a normal physiologic process that uses a positive feedback loop?"
Correct Answer: childbirth
Explanation: Positive feedback loops amplify the initial stimulus. During childbirth, uterine contractions stimulate further oxytocin release, which causes stronger contractions, escalating until the baby is born. Blood pressure, fluid balance, and temperature regulation are primarily controlled by negative feedback loops, which counteract the initial stimulus to maintain homeostasis.
Question 1.20: "What is the position of the body when it is in the “normal anatomical position?”"
Correct Answer: None of the above
Explanation: The standard anatomical position is standing upright, facing the observer, feet parallel and flat on the floor, upper limbs at the sides, with palms facing forward. Prone means lying face down; supine means lying face up. The other descriptions are incorrect.
Question 1.21: "To make a banana split, you halve a banana into two long, thin, right and left sides along the ________."
Correct Answer: midsagittal plane
Explanation: A midsagittal (or median) plane divides a structure vertically into equal right and left halves. A coronal (frontal) plane divides into anterior and posterior parts. A transverse (horizontal) plane divides into superior and inferior parts. A longitudinal plane is any plane along the long axis, but midsagittal is the specific plane described.
Question 1.22: "The lumbar region is ________."
Correct Answer: superior to the popliteal region
Explanation: The lumbar region is the lower back. The popliteal region is the back of the knee. Therefore, the lumbar region is superior (above) the popliteal region. It is superior to the gluteal (buttock) region, inferior (below) the umbilical (navel) region, and inferior to the cervical (neck) region.
Question 1.23: "The heart is within the ________."
Correct Answer: mediastinum
Explanation: The mediastinum is the central compartment of the thoracic cavity, located between the lungs, which contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, and major blood vessels. The cranial cavity contains the brain. The posterior (dorsal) cavity contains the brain and spinal cord. The heart is in the anterior (ventral) cavity, specifically the thoracic cavity, within the mediastinum.
Question 1.24: "In 1901, Wilhelm Röntgen was the first person to win the Nobel Prize for physics. For what discovery did he win?"
Correct Answer: X-rays
Explanation: Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, a form of electromagnetic radiation that could pass through soft tissues but not denser materials like bone, revolutionizing medical imaging.
Question 1.25: "Which of the following imaging techniques would be best to use to study the uptake of nutrients by rapidly multiplying cancer cells?"
Correct Answer: PET
Explanation: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) uses radioactive tracers (often attached to glucose) to visualize metabolic activity. Since cancer cells are typically highly metabolic and consume large amounts of glucose, PET is excellent for detecting them and assessing nutrient uptake. CT and MRI primarily show structure, and ultrasonography uses sound waves.
Question 1.26: "Which of the following imaging studies can be used most safely during pregnancy?"
Correct Answer: ultrasounds
Explanation: Ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound waves, not ionizing radiation, making it the safest imaging modality for monitoring fetal development during pregnancy. CT scans, X-rays, and PET scans involve ionizing radiation, which poses potential risks to the developing fetus.
Question 1.27: "What are two major disadvantages of MRI scans?"
Correct Answer: high cost and the need for shielding from the magnetic signals (interpreted as high cost and patient contraindications/discomfort due to the strong magnet and confined space)
Explanation: While very detailed, MRI scans are expensive. The strong magnetic field means patients with certain metallic implants cannot undergo MRI, and the confined space of the scanner can be problematic for claustrophobic individuals. It takes time (often 30 minutes or more). MRI does not use ionizing radiation. Option B has a partially correct point (high cost) but shielding is for the room, not the patient directly, and the main patient issue is the confinement and metal contraindications. Self-correction: Re-evaluating the options provided, option B mentions high cost and the need for shielding which is true for the facility, but a more patient-centric disadvantage paired with high cost relates to the procedure itself. Option D mentions radiation (incorrect for MRI) and confinement (correct). Option C is incorrect. Considering common knowledge, the high cost and issues related to the strong magnetic field (patient confinement, noise, metal implants) are the key drawbacks. Option B is the closest, though phrased slightly awkwardly. The most accurate common disadvantages are the high cost and patient factors like claustrophobia and metal implant contraindications. None of the options perfectly capture this. Option B is likely the intended answer focusing on cost and the technical requirement of shielding.


# Chapter 2: The Chemical Level of Organization

Question 2.4: "Together, just four elements make up more than 95 percent of the body’s mass. These include ________."
Correct Answer: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
Explanation: These four elements (O, C, H, N) are the most abundant in the human body, forming the backbone of organic molecules like proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as water.
Question 2.5: "The smallest unit of an element that still retains the distinctive behavior of that element is an ________."
Correct Answer: atom
Explanation: An atom is the basic unit of a chemical element. Electrons are subatomic particles. Isotopes are variants of an element with different numbers of neutrons.
Question 2.6: "The characteristic that gives an element its distinctive properties is its number of ________."
Correct Answer: protons
Explanation: The atomic number, defined by the number of protons in the nucleus, determines the identity of an element. The number of neutrons defines isotopes, and the number of electrons (in a neutral atom) equals the number of protons but determines chemical reactivity.
Question 2.7: "On the periodic table of the elements, mercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80 and a mass number of 200.59. It has seven stable isotopes. The most abundant of these probably have ________."
Correct Answer: more than 80 neutrons each
Explanation: The mass number is approximately the sum of protons and neutrons. Since the atomic number (protons) is 80, and the average mass number is ~200.6, the average number of neutrons is roughly 200.6 - 80 = 120.6. The most abundant isotopes will have a neutron count close to this average, which is significantly more than 80.
Question 2.8: "Nitrogen has an atomic number of seven. How many electron shells does it likely have?"
Correct Answer: two
Explanation: A neutral nitrogen atom has 7 electrons. The first electron shell holds a maximum of 2 electrons. The remaining 5 electrons occupy the second electron shell.
Question 2.9: "Which of the following is a molecule, but not a compound?"
Correct Answer: H2
Explanation: A molecule consists of two or more atoms bonded together. A compound is a molecule made of different types of atoms. H2 (hydrogen gas) is a molecule because it's two hydrogen atoms bonded, but it's not a compound because both atoms are the same element. H2O is both a molecule and a compound. 2H represents two separate hydrogen atoms, not a molecule. H+ is a hydrogen ion.
Question 2.10: "A molecule of ammonia contains one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen. These are linked with ________."
Correct Answer: polar covalent bonds
Explanation: Nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, meaning it attracts the shared electrons in the N-H bonds more strongly. This unequal sharing creates a partial negative charge on the nitrogen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens, resulting in polar covalent bonds.
Question 2.11: "When an atom donates an electron to another atom, it becomes"
Correct Answer: an ion
Explanation: An ion is an atom that has gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge. Specifically, an atom that donates (loses) an electron becomes a positively charged ion (a cation). Since a cation is a type of ion, "an ion" is the most general correct answer. It is not an anion (negatively charged ion) and it becomes charged, not nonpolar.
Question 2.12: "A substance formed of crystals of equal numbers of cations and anions held together by ionic bonds is called a(n) ________."
Correct Answer: salt
Explanation: Salts are ionic compounds formed from the reaction of an acid and a base, consisting of cations and anions held together by ionic bonds in a crystal lattice structure (e.g., NaCl). Electrolytes are substances that produce ions when dissolved in water (salts are electrolytes). Noble gases are unreactive elements. A dipole refers to a separation of charge within a molecule.
Question 2.13: "Which of the following statements about chemical bonds is true?"
Correct Answer: None of the above (based on typical bond strengths) - Self-correction: Re-evaluating common knowledge. Covalent bonds are generally stronger than ionic bonds within molecules in a biological context (aqueous environment). Hydrogen bonds are weak attractions between molecules or parts of large molecules, typically involving hydrogen and O, N, or F. Polar and nonpolar molecules have different interaction properties. Water, being polar, readily interacts with ions. Let's re-examine the options assuming typical chemistry definitions:
Ionic bonds are stronger than Covalent bonds: Generally, covalent bonds are considered stronger (require more energy to break) than ionic bonds, especially in aqueous solutions.
Hydrogen bonds occur between two atoms of hydrogen: False. Hydrogen bonds occur between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like O or N) and another nearby electronegative atom.
Bonding readily occurs between nonpolar and polar molecules: False. "Like dissolves like"; polar molecules tend to interact with other polar molecules and ions, while nonpolar molecules interact with other nonpolar molecules. Significant bonding between polar and nonpolar is less favorable.
A molecule of water is unlikely to bond with an ion: False. Water is highly polar and readily forms hydration shells around ions via ion-dipole interactions (a type of intermolecular force, sometimes loosely referred to as bonding in this context).
Revised Correct Answer: Given the typical context of introductory biology/chemistry, there might be nuances. However, based on standard definitions, none of these statements are unequivocally true without qualification. There might be an intended answer based on the specific textbook's definition, but strictly speaking, all options are problematic or false. If forced to choose the "most true" in a biological context, one might argue about bond strengths, but the other options are clearly false. Let's assume the question or options might be flawed. If we must pick one, let's reconsider bond strengths. In a vacuum, ionic bonds in a crystal lattice can be very strong. Covalent bonds within a molecule are also very strong. It's context-dependent. Let's assume there isn't a single correct answer among the choices as written.
Question 2.14: "The energy stored in a foot of snow on a steep roof is ________."
Correct Answer: potential energy
Explanation: Potential energy is stored energy due to position or state. The snow has potential energy because of its position high on the roof in a gravitational field. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Radiant energy is energy transmitted as waves. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a reaction.
Question 2.15: "The bonding of calcium, phosphorus, and other elements produces mineral crystals that are found in bone. This is an example of a(n) ________ reaction."
Correct Answer: synthesis
Explanation: A synthesis reaction (or anabolic reaction) involves combining smaller molecules or elements to form a larger, more complex molecule (in this case, bone mineral crystals). Catabolic or decomposition reactions break down complex molecules. Exchange reactions involve swapping components between molecules.
Question 2.16: "AB→A+B is a general notation for a(n) ________ reaction."
Correct Answer: decomposition
Explanation: This notation represents a single, larger reactant (AB) breaking down into smaller products (A + B), which is the definition of a decomposition (or catabolic) reaction. Anabolic reactions build larger molecules (A + B → AB). Endergonic reactions require energy input. Exchange reactions involve swapping parts (AB + CD → AD + CB).
Question 2.17: "________ reactions release energy."
Correct Answer: Catabolic, exergonic, and decomposition
Explanation: Catabolic reactions break down molecules, decomposition reactions are a type of catabolism, and exergonic reactions are defined as processes that release energy. Therefore, all three terms describe energy-releasing reactions.
Question 2.18: "Which of the following combinations of atoms is most likely to result in a chemical reaction?"
Correct Answer: hydrogen and hydrogen
Explanation: Hydrogen atoms have only one electron and seek to gain stability by sharing electrons to form a covalent bond (H2 molecule). Helium and Neon are noble gases with stable, full outer electron shells, making them extremely unreactive. Therefore, hydrogen atoms are far more likely to react (with each other) than combinations involving Helium or Neon.
Question 2.19: "Chewing a bite of bread mixes it with saliva and facilitates its chemical breakdown. This is most likely due to the fact that ________."
Correct Answer: saliva contains enzymes
Explanation: Saliva contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of starch (a primary component of bread) into smaller sugars. Chewing (mastication) is mechanical digestion, increasing surface area, but the chemical breakdown is enzymatic. Mouth temperature is regulated but not exceptionally high. Chewing facilitates breakdown (catabolism), not primarily synthesis.
Question 2.20: "CH4 is methane. This compound is ________."
Correct Answer: organic
Explanation: Organic compounds are generally defined as those containing carbon-hydrogen bonds. Methane (CH4) fits this definition. While it can be reactive (e.g., combustion), and it's a gas not a crystal at room temperature, its fundamental classification here is organic.
Question 2.21: "Which of the following is most likely to be found evenly distributed in water in a homogeneous solution?"
Correct Answer: sodium ions and chloride ions
Explanation: When an ionic compound like NaCl (salt) dissolves in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions (Na+ and Cl-), which become evenly distributed among the water molecules, forming a homogeneous solution. NaCl molecules do not exist as discrete units in solution. Salt crystals are the solid form. Red blood cells are much larger particles and would form a suspension, not a true solution.
Question 2.22: "Jenny mixes up a batch of pancake batter, then stirs in some chocolate chips. As she is waiting for the first few pancakes to cook, she notices the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom of the clear glass mixing bowl. The chocolate-chip batter is an example of a ________."
Correct Answer: suspension
Explanation: A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which larger particles (chocolate chips) are dispersed in a medium (batter) but tend to settle out over time. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. A solvent is the dissolving medium, and a solute is the substance being dissolved.
Question 2.23: "A substance dissociates into K+ and Cl– in solution. The substance is a(n) ________."
Correct Answer: salt
Explanation: This substance (KCl, potassium chloride) is an ionic compound formed from a cation (K+) and an anion (Cl-) that are not H+ or OH-. This fits the definition of a salt. Acids release H+ ions; bases release OH- ions (or accept H+). Buffers resist pH changes.
Question 2.24: "Ty is three years old and as a result of a “stomach bug” has been vomiting for about 24 hours. His blood pH is 7.48. What does this mean?"
Correct Answer: Ty’s blood is slightly alkaline.
Explanation: Normal blood pH is tightly regulated between 7.35 and 7.45. A pH above 7.45 is considered alkalosis (alkaline). Since 7.48 is slightly above the normal range, his blood is slightly alkaline. Vomiting causes loss of stomach acid (HCl), leading to metabolic alkalosis.
Question 2.25: "C6H12O6 is the chemical formula for a ________."
Correct Answer: hexose monosaccharide
Explanation: This formula represents simple sugars (monosaccharides) with six carbon atoms (hexoses), such as glucose, fructose, and galactose. Pentose sugars have 5 carbons. A polymer of carbohydrate is a polysaccharide (e.g., starch, glycogen).
Question 2.26: "What organic compound do brain cells primarily rely on for fuel?"
Correct Answer: glucose
Explanation: Glucose is the primary and preferred energy source for brain cells under normal conditions. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose. Galactose is another monosaccharide. Glycerol is part of a triglyceride.
Question 2.27: "Which of the following is a functional group that is part of a building block of proteins?"
Correct Answer: amino
Explanation: The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Each amino acid contains a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a1 variable side chain (R group).2 Phosphate groups are key in nucleic acids and ATP. Adenine is a nitrogenous base in nucleic acids and ATP. Ribose is a sugar in RNA and ATP.

Question 2.28: "A pentose sugar is a part of the monomer used to build which type of macromolecule?"
Correct Answer: nucleic acids
Explanation: Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are polymers made of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a nitrogenous base, and a pentose (5-carbon) sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA). Polysaccharides are made of monosaccharides (usually hexoses). Glycogen is a polysaccharide.
Question 2.29: "A phospholipid ________."
Correct Answer: has both polar and nonpolar regions
Explanation: Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules, meaning they have a hydrophilic (polar) phosphate "head" and hydrophobic (nonpolar) fatty acid "tails." This property is crucial for forming cell membranes. They are derived from diglycerides (not triglycerides) bonded to a phosphate group. They are components of membranes, not ATP building blocks, and don't typically donate ions like acids/bases.
Question 2.30: "In DNA, nucleotide bonding forms a compound with a characteristic shape known as a(n) ________."
Correct Answer: double helix
Explanation: DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands wound around each other in a spiral shape, known as the double helix. Beta chains, pleated sheets, and alpha helices are structures found in proteins.
Question 2.31: "Uracil ________."
Correct Answer: all of the above
Explanation: Uracil is a nitrogenous base (contains nitrogen) that replaces thymine in RNA. It belongs to the pyrimidine group of bases (single-ring structure). Therefore, all the statements are correct.
Question 2.32: "The ability of an enzyme’s active sites to bind only substrates of compatible shape and charge is known as ________."
Correct Answer: specificity
Explanation: Enzyme specificity refers to the precise fit between an enzyme's active site and its specific substrate(s), determined by shape and chemical properties, allowing the enzyme to catalyze only certain reactions.

# Chapter 3: The Cellular Level of Organization

Question 3.6: "Because they are embedded within the membrane, ion channels are examples of ________."
Correct Answer: integral proteins
Explanation: Integral proteins are embedded within, and often span, the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Ion channels are typically transmembrane proteins that fit this description. Peripheral proteins are loosely attached to the membrane surface. Receptor proteins bind ligands but can be integral or peripheral. Glycoproteins are proteins with attached carbohydrates.
Question 3.7: "The diffusion of substances within a solution tends to move those substances ________ their ________ gradient."
Correct Answer: down; concentration
Explanation: Diffusion is the passive movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, following or moving "down" the concentration gradient. Electrochemical gradients involve both concentration and charge.
Question 3.8: "Ion pumps and phagocytosis are both examples of ________."
Correct Answer: active transport
Explanation: Active transport requires energy (usually ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient or to transport large materials. Ion pumps move ions against their gradients, and phagocytosis (a type of endocytosis) engulfs large particles, both requiring energy. Passive transport (like diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis) does not require cellular energy.
Question 3.9: "Choose the answer that best completes the following analogy: Diffusion is to ________ as endocytosis is to ________."
Correct Answer: osmosis; pinocytosis
Explanation: Diffusion is the general movement of solutes down a gradient; osmosis is the specific diffusion of water across a membrane. Endocytosis is the general process of bringing material into the cell; pinocytosis ("cell drinking") is a specific type of endocytosis involving fluids. Phagocytosis ("cell eating") is another type of endocytosis. Option D relates concepts (gradient, energy) but not specific processes in the same way.
Question 3.10: "Choose the term that best completes the following analogy: Cytoplasm is to cytosol as a swimming pool containing chlorine and flotation toys is to ________."
Correct Answer: the water
Explanation: Cytoplasm refers to everything within the cell membrane but outside the nucleus, including organelles and the fluid cytosol. Cytosol is just the fluid component. In the analogy, the swimming pool with everything in it represents the cytoplasm, while just the water represents the cytosol.
Question 3.11: "The rough ER has its name due to what associated structures?"
Correct Answer: ribosomes
Explanation: The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is studded with ribosomes on its outer surface, giving it a "rough" appearance under electron microscopy. These ribosomes synthesize proteins destined for secretion, insertion into membranes, or delivery to certain organelles.
Question 3.12: "Which of the following is a function of the rough ER?"
Correct Answer: production of proteins (Specifically, modification and folding of proteins synthesized by attached ribosomes)
Explanation: The RER modifies, folds, and packages proteins synthesized by its attached ribosomes. Detoxification, lipid synthesis (including steroids), and calcium storage are primarily functions of the smooth ER.
Question 3.13: "Which of the following is a feature common to all three components of the cytoskeleton?"
Correct Answer: They are all polymers of protein subunits.
Explanation: The cytoskeleton's components – microfilaments (actin polymers), intermediate filaments (various protein polymers like keratin), and microtubules (tubulin polymers) – are all formed by the polymerization of specific protein monomers. While they contribute to scaffolding and resisting forces, their diameters differ, and their specific roles in these functions vary.
Question 3.14: "Which of the following organelles produces large quantities of ATP when both glucose and oxygen are available to the cell?"
Correct Answer: mitochondria
Explanation: Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic cellular respiration, the process that efficiently generates large amounts of ATP using glucose (or other fuels) and oxygen. Peroxisomes handle metabolic waste, lysosomes break down materials, and the ER is involved in synthesis and transport.
Question 3.15: "The nucleus and mitochondria share which of the following features?"
Correct Answer: a double cell membrane
Explanation: Both the nucleus (nuclear envelope) and mitochondria possess a double membrane (inner and outer). Only the nucleus has prominent protein-lined pores (nuclear pores) and is the primary site of ribosome synthesis (in the nucleolus). Mitochondria produce most cellular ATP, while the nucleus controls cell activities.
Question 3.16: "Which of the following structures could be found within the nucleolus?"
Correct Answer: ribosomes (Specifically, ribosome components are synthesized here)
Explanation: The nucleolus, located within the nucleus, is the primary site of ribosome RNA (rRNA) synthesis and the assembly of ribosomal subunits. Chromatin (DNA and associated proteins, including histones which form nucleosomes) is found throughout the nucleus but outside the nucleolus itself.
Question 3.17: "Which of the following sequences on a DNA molecule would be complementary to GCTTATAT?"
Correct Answer: CGAATATA
Explanation: DNA base pairing rules are Adenine (A) with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) with Cytosine (C). Therefore, the complementary strand to G-C-T-T-A-T-A-T is C-G-A-A-T-A-T-A.
Question 3.18: "Place the following structures in order from least to most complex organization: chromatin, nucleosome, DNA, chromosome"
Correct Answer: DNA, nucleosome, chromatin, chromosome
Explanation: DNA is the fundamental molecule. DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes coil and condense to form chromatin fibers. Chromatin further condenses significantly to form visible chromosomes, especially during cell division.
Question 3.19: "Which of the following is part of the elongation step of DNA synthesis?"
Correct Answer: attaching complementary nucleotides to the template strand
Explanation: During the elongation phase of DNA replication, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand and adds complementary nucleotides to build the new DNA strand. Pulling apart strands and untwisting the helix occur during the initiation phase (helicase activity).
Question 3.20: "Which of the following is not a difference between DNA and RNA?"
Correct Answer: DNA contains alternating sugar-phosphate molecules whereas RNA does not contain sugars
Explanation: This statement is false, making it the correct answer to the "not a difference" question. Both DNA and RNA have backbones composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The key differences are: DNA has deoxyribose sugar, RNA has ribose sugar; DNA uses thymine (T), RNA uses uracil (U); DNA is usually double-stranded, RNA is usually single-stranded.
Question 3.21: "Transcription and translation take place in the ________ and ________, respectively."
Correct Answer: nucleus; cytoplasm
Explanation: In eukaryotic cells, transcription (DNA to RNA) occurs in the nucleus where the DNA resides. Translation (RNA to protein) occurs in the cytoplasm on ribosomes.
Question 3.22: "How many “letters” of an RNA molecule, in sequence, does it take to provide the code for a single amino acid?"
Correct Answer: 3
Explanation: The genetic code is read in triplets of RNA bases called codons. Each codon (sequence of 3 bases) specifies a particular amino acid (or a start/stop signal).
Question 3.23: "Which of the following is not entirely or mostly made out of RNA?"
Correct Answer: the intron
Explanation: Introns are non-coding sequences within a gene (DNA). While they are transcribed into the initial pre-mRNA, they are then spliced out before translation. The carriers for amino acids are transfer RNAs (tRNA). Ribosomes are made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein. The messenger molecule is messenger RNA (mRNA).
Question 3.24: "Which of the following phases is characterized by preparation for DNA synthesis?"
Correct Answer: G1
Explanation: The cell cycle phases are: G1 (Gap 1 - cell growth, preparation for DNA synthesis), S (Synthesis - DNA replication), G2 (Gap 2 - preparation for mitosis), and M (Mitosis - cell division). G0 is a resting phase outside the active cycle.
Question 3.25: "A mutation in the gene for a cyclin protein might result in which of the following?"
Correct Answer: any of the above
Explanation: Cyclins are key regulators of the cell cycle checkpoints. A mutation could disrupt this regulation, potentially leading to: cells dividing with incorrect amounts of genetic material (too much or too less if checkpoints fail) or uncontrolled cell division (cancer) if the cyclin normally acts as a brake or its malfunction removes necessary checks.
Question 3.26: "What is a primary function of tumor suppressor genes?"
Correct Answer: stop certain cells from dividing
Explanation: Tumor suppressor genes code for proteins that normally act as brakes on cell division, either by inhibiting progress through the cell cycle or initiating apoptosis (programmed cell death) if damage is detected. Mutations inactivating these genes can lead to uncontrolled proliferation (cancer). They don't stop all cells, help oncogenes (which promote cancer), or allow skipping phases.
Question 3.27: "Arrange the following terms in order of increasing specialization: oligopotency, pleuripotency, unipotency, multipotency."
Correct Answer: pleuripotency, multipotency, oligopotency, unipotency
Explanation: Stem cell potency describes the range of cell types a cell can differentiate into:
Pleuripotency: Can become any cell type of the three germ layers (e.g., embryonic stem cells). (Least specialized among these options)
Multipotency: Can become multiple cell types within a specific lineage or germ layer (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells).
Oligopotency: Can become a few different cell types within a specific lineage (e.g., lymphoid stem cells).
Unipotency: Can only become one specific cell type (e.g., skin stem cells producing only keratinocytes). (Most specialized)
Question 3.28: "Which type of stem cell gives rise to red and white blood cells?"
Correct Answer: hematopoietic
Explanation: Hematopoietic stem cells, found in bone marrow, are multipotent stem cells responsible for generating all blood cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, etc.), and platelets. Endothelial cells line blood vessels, epithelial cells cover surfaces, and mesenchymal stem cells give rise to bone, cartilage, fat, etc.
Question 3.29: "What multipotent stem cells from children sometimes banked by parents?"
Correct Answer: cells from the umbilical cord and from baby teeth
Explanation: Umbilical cord blood and the pulp of deciduous (baby) teeth contain multipotent stem cells (including hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells) that can be cryogenically preserved (banked) for potential future therapeutic use. Fetal and embryonic stem cells have different origins and ethical considerations. Red and white blood cells themselves are differentiated and not stem cells suitable for banking in this context.

# Chapter 4: The Tissue Level of Organization

Question 4.7: "Which of the following is not a type of tissue?"
Correct Answer: embryonic
Explanation: The four primary types of adult tissues are epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. Embryonic refers to a developmental stage, during which these tissues differentiate from germ layers.
Question 4.8: "The process by which a less specialized cell matures into a more specialized cell is called ________."
Correct Answer: differentiation
Explanation: Differentiation is the process where cells acquire specialized structures and functions. Maturation and specialization are related concepts but differentiation is the specific biological term.
Question 4.9: "Differentiated cells in a developing embryo derive from ________."
Correct Answer: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm
Explanation: These are the three primary germ layers formed during early embryonic development (gastrulation). All tissues and organs of the body differentiate from one or more of these layers. The other options list specific tissues or membranes derived from the germ layers.
Question 4.10: "Which of the following lines the body cavities exposed to the external environment?"
Correct Answer: mucosa (mucous membrane)
Explanation: Mucous membranes (mucosae) line cavities and passageways that open to the external environment, such as the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Mesothelium lines body cavities not open to the outside (pleural, pericardial, peritoneal). Lamina propria is the connective tissue layer within a mucous membrane. Mesenteries are folds of peritoneum supporting abdominal organs.
Question 4.11: "In observing epithelial cells under a microscope, the cells are arranged in a single layer and look tall and narrow, and the nucleus is located close to the basal side of the cell. The specimen is what type of epithelial tissue?"
Correct Answer: columnar (Specifically, simple columnar epithelium)
Explanation: This description matches simple columnar epithelium: a single layer (simple) of tall, narrow cells (columnar) with elongated nuclei typically located near the base. Stratified means multiple layers. Squamous cells are flat. Transitional epithelium changes shape and is found in the urinary tract.
Question 4.12: "Which of the following is the epithelial tissue that lines the interior of blood vessels?"
Correct Answer: simple squamous (Specifically called endothelium)
Explanation: The lining of blood vessels (and lymphatic vessels and heart chambers) is a specialized simple squamous epithelium called endothelium. Its thin, flat cells allow for efficient diffusion and smooth blood flow.
Question 4.13: "Which type of epithelial tissue specializes in moving particles across its surface?"
Correct Answer: pseudostratified ciliated columnar
Explanation: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, found lining much of the respiratory tract, has cilia on its apical surface that beat rhythmically to propel mucus and trapped particles upwards, away from the lungs. While some simple columnar epithelia can be ciliated (like in uterine tubes), pseudostratified ciliated columnar is the classic example for moving particles along airways.
Question 4.14: "The ________ exocrine gland stores its secretion until the glandular cell ruptures, whereas the ________ gland releases its apical region and reforms."
Correct Answer: holocrine; apocrine
Explanation: Exocrine glands are classified by secretion mode:
Holocrine: Entire cell disintegrates to release secretion (e.g., sebaceous glands).
Apocrine: Apical portion of the cell pinches off with secretion (e.g., some sweat glands, mammary glands).
Merocrine (or Eccrine): Secretion released by exocytosis (most common, e.g., typical sweat glands, salivary glands).
Question 4.15: "Connective tissue is made of which three essential components?"
Correct Answer: cells, ground substance, and protein fibers
Explanation: All connective tissues share three fundamental components: specialized cells (e.g., fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteocytes), ground substance (an amorphous gel-like material filling the space between cells and fibers), and protein fibers (collagen, elastic, reticular). The ground substance and fibers together constitute the extracellular matrix.
Question 4.16: "Under the microscope, a tissue specimen shows cells located in spaces scattered in a transparent background. This is probably ________."
Correct Answer: hyaline cartilage
Explanation: Cartilage features cells called chondrocytes residing within spaces called lacunae, scattered within an extensive extracellular matrix. Hyaline cartilage, the most common type, has a smooth, glassy (transparent) matrix due to fine collagen fibers. Loose connective tissue has more visible fibers and less matrix density. Tendons have densely packed parallel fibers. Bone has a calcified matrix arranged in osteons or trabeculae.
Question 4.17: "Which connective tissue specializes in storage of fat?"
Correct Answer: adipose tissue
Explanation: Adipose tissue is a type of loose connective tissue composed primarily of adipocytes (fat cells) specialized for storing lipids (triglycerides).
Question 4.18: "Ligaments connect bones together and withstand a lot of stress. What type of connective tissue should you expect ligaments to contain?"
Correct Answer: dense regular connective tissue
Explanation: Ligaments (and tendons) require great tensile strength to resist pulling forces in a specific direction. This is provided by dense regular connective tissue, characterized by tightly packed collagen fibers arranged parallel to each other. Dense irregular tissue has collagen fibers in random orientations (resists stress from multiple directions, found in dermis). Areolar tissue is loose connective tissue.
Question 4.19: "In adults, new connective tissue cells originate from the ________."
Correct Answer: mesenchyme (specifically, residual mesenchymal stem cells)
Explanation: Mesenchyme is the embryonic connective tissue from which almost all adult connective tissues arise. While originating from the mesoderm germ layer, residual mesenchymal stem cells persist in many adult connective tissues and can differentiate into various connective tissue cell types (like fibroblasts, chondroblasts, osteoblasts) for growth and repair.
Question 4.20: "In bone, the main cells are ________."
Correct Answer: osteocytes
Explanation: Osteocytes are mature bone cells residing in lacunae within the calcified bone matrix. They maintain the bone tissue. Osteoblasts build bone, osteoclasts break down bone, and osteoprogenitor cells are bone stem cells. Fibroblasts are typical in fibrous connective tissue, chondrocytes in cartilage, and lymphocytes are immune cells.
Question 4.21: "Striations, cylindrical cells, and multiple nuclei are observed in ________."
Correct Answer: skeletal muscle only
Explanation: Skeletal muscle cells (fibers) are long, cylindrical, multinucleated, and exhibit striations (stripes) due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. Cardiac muscle cells are also striated but are typically branched, shorter, and have only one or two nuclei, connected by intercalated discs. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped, non-striated, and have a single nucleus.
Question 4.22: "The cells of muscles, myocytes, develop from ________."
Correct Answer: myoblasts
Explanation: Myoblasts are embryonic precursor cells that fuse together to form multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers (myocytes). Smooth and cardiac muscle cells also develop from precursor cells derived from mesoderm. Fibrocytes are related to fibroblasts (connective tissue), chondrocytes are cartilage cells.
Question 4.23: "Skeletal muscle is composed of very hard working cells. Which organelles do you expect to find in abundance in skeletal muscle cell?"
Correct Answer: mitochondria
Explanation: Skeletal muscle contraction requires large amounts of ATP. Mitochondria are the organelles responsible for generating ATP through aerobic respiration, so they are very abundant in muscle cells to meet the high energy demand. While skeletal muscle cells have multiple nuclei and striations (structural features, not organelles in the typical sense), and Golgi bodies (involved in processing/packaging), mitochondria are exceptionally numerous due to the energy requirement.
Question 4.24: "The cells responsible for the transmission of the nerve impulse are ________."
Correct Answer: neurons
Explanation: Neurons (nerve cells) are specialized to generate and transmit electrical and chemical signals (nerve impulses or action potentials). Oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia are types of glial cells (neuroglia) that support and protect neurons but do not transmit the primary nerve impulse.
Question 4.25: "The nerve impulse travels down a(n) ________, away from the cell body."
Correct Answer: axon
Explanation: The axon is the long projection of a neuron that conducts nerve impulses (action potentials) away from the neuron's cell body (soma) towards target cells (other neurons, muscles, or glands). Dendrites typically receive signals and transmit them towards the cell body. Microglia are glial cells. Collagen fiber is a component of connective tissue.
Question 4.26: "Which of the following central nervous system cells regulate ions, regulate the uptake and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters, and contribute to the formation of the blood-brain barrier?"
Correct Answer: astrocytes
Explanation: Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells in the CNS with numerous functions, including maintaining the chemical environment around neurons (regulating ions, neurotransmitter uptake), contributing to the blood-brain barrier, providing structural support, and regulating blood flow. Microglia are immune cells, oligodendrocytes form myelin in the CNS. Neuroglia is the general term for glial cells.
Question 4.27: "Which of the following processes is not a cardinal sign of inflammation?"
Correct Answer: fever
Explanation: The four (or five) cardinal signs of localized inflammation are redness (rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), and pain (dolor). Loss of function (functio laesa) is sometimes considered the fifth sign. Fever (pyrexia) is a systemic (body-wide) increase in temperature, often associated with inflammation or infection, but not a localized sign itself.
Question 4.28: "When a mast cell reacts to an irritation, which of the following chemicals does it release?"
Correct Answer: histamine
Explanation: Mast cells, found in connective tissues, play a key role in inflammation and allergic reactions. Upon stimulation (e.g., by allergens or tissue damage), they release granules containing histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Collagen and hyaluronic acid are matrix components. Myelin forms nerve insulation.
Question 4.29: "Atrophy refers to ________."
Correct Answer: loss of mass
Explanation: Atrophy is the decrease in size or wasting away of a body part or tissue, typically due to underuse, disease, or denervation, leading to a loss of mass.
Question 4.30: "Individuals can slow the rate of aging by modifying all of these lifestyle aspects except for ________."
Correct Answer: genetic factors
Explanation: While diet, exercise, and stress management are lifestyle factors that can influence the rate of aging and associated health problems, an individual's genetic makeup, which also plays a significant role in aging and longevity, cannot be modified through lifestyle choices.

# Chapter 5: The Integumentary System

Question 5.5: "The papillary layer of the dermis is most closely associated with which layer of the epidermis?"
Correct Answer: stratum basale
Explanation: The papillary layer of the dermis interdigitates (forms projections called dermal papillae) with the overlying stratum basale of the epidermis, providing adhesion and facilitating nutrient/waste exchange.
Question 5.6: "Langerhans cells are commonly found in the ________."
Correct Answer: stratum spinosum
Explanation: Langerhans cells (a type of dendritic cell) are immune cells found primarily in the stratum spinosum layer of the epidermis, where they act as antigen-presenting cells.
Question 5.7: "The papillary and reticular layers of the dermis are composed mainly of ________."
Correct Answer: connective tissue
Explanation: The dermis is primarily composed of connective tissue. The papillary layer is loose areolar connective tissue, and the reticular layer is dense irregular connective tissue, containing collagen and elastic fibers, blood vessels, nerves, and accessory structures. Melanocytes and keratinocytes are found in the epidermis. Adipose tissue is mainly in the hypodermis.
Question 5.8: "Collagen lends ________ to the skin."
Correct Answer: structure (or strength)
Explanation: Collagen fibers provide tensile strength and structural integrity to the dermis, resisting stretching and tearing. Elastic fibers provide elasticity (the ability to recoil). Melanocytes provide color (melanin). Keratinocytes provide UV protection (via melanin uptake) and form the physical barrier.
Question 5.9: "Which of the following is not a function of the hypodermis?"
Correct Answer: source of blood vessels in the epidermis
Explanation: The epidermis is avascular (lacks blood vessels); it receives nutrients by diffusion from the underlying dermis. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer) connects skin to underlying fascia, protects organs, helps insulate and maintain temperature, and stores energy (adipose tissue). Blood vessels are found in the hypodermis and dermis, but they don't directly supply the epidermis.
Question 5.10: "In response to stimuli from the sympathetic nervous system, the arrector pili ________."
Correct Answer: are responsible for goose bumps
Explanation: Arrector pili are small smooth muscles attached to hair follicles. When stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system (due to cold or fear), they contract, pulling the hair follicle upright and causing the skin surface to dimple, resulting in "goose bumps." They are muscles, not glands, and don't secrete sebum (that's sebaceous glands) or directly cause sweating (that's sweat glands).
Question 5.11: "The hair matrix contains ________."
Correct Answer: a layer of basal cells
Explanation: The hair matrix is a layer of mitotically active basal cells (keratinocytes) located within the hair bulb at the base of the hair follicle. These cells divide and differentiate to produce the cells that form the hair shaft. The hair follicle is the entire structure surrounding the root. The hair shaft is the visible part of the hair. The glassy membrane is part of the follicle wall.
Question 5.12: "Eccrine sweat glands ________."
Correct Answer: are present in the skin throughout the body and produce watery sweat
Explanation: Eccrine (or merocrine) sweat glands are the most numerous type, found throughout the body surface, especially on palms, soles, and forehead. They produce a watery sweat primarily composed of water and salts, which helps in thermoregulation via evaporation. They are not directly present on hair (though their ducts open onto the skin surface), they don't produce sebum, and while sweat can hydrate the skin surface, their primary role isn't moisturizing in the same way as sebum.
Question 5.13: "Sebaceous glands ________."
Correct Answer: are associated with hair follicles
Explanation: Sebaceous glands are oil glands that typically secrete sebum (an oily substance) into hair follicles to lubricate the hair and skin. Some open directly onto the skin surface. They are not sweat glands and don't release watery solutions; their secretion is oily. Their function isn't primarily related to touch sensation.
Question 5.14: "Similar to the hair, nails grow continuously throughout our lives. Which of the following is furthest from the nail growth center?"
Correct Answer: hyponychium
Explanation: Nail growth occurs at the nail matrix (part of the nail root, the growth center). The nail body grows distally over the nail bed. The eponychium (cuticle) is at the proximal end. The hyponychium is the area of thickened epidermis under the free edge of the nail, furthest from the nail root/matrix.
Question 5.15: "In humans, exposure of the skin to sunlight is required for ________."
Correct Answer: vitamin D synthesis
Explanation: UV radiation from sunlight triggers the conversion of a precursor molecule (7-dehydrocholesterol) in the skin into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is then further processed by the liver and kidneys into the active form of vitamin D. Sunlight exposure can cause arteriole dilation (not constriction) for heat loss. It degrades, rather than produces, folate. Thermoregulation involves various mechanisms, but vitamin D synthesis is the specific process directly requiring sunlight on the skin.
Question 5.16: "One of the functions of the integumentary system is protection. Which of the following does not directly contribute to that function?"
Correct Answer: folic acid synthesis
Explanation: The skin protects against UV radiation, pathogens, water loss, and physical abrasion. The stratum lucidum (in thick skin) adds an extra layer. Desmosomes tightly join keratinocytes, providing mechanical strength. Merkel cells are touch receptors, contributing to sensory protection. Folic acid (folate) is actually degraded by UV light; the skin protects existing folate stores in the body but does not synthesize it. Melanin protects against UV damage, which helps preserve folate.
Question 5.17: "An individual using a sharp knife notices a small amount of blood where he just cut himself. Which of the following layers of skin did he have to cut into in order to bleed?"
Correct Answer: papillary dermis
Explanation: Bleeding occurs when blood vessels are damaged. The epidermis (stratum corneum, granulosum, basale, etc.) is avascular. The dermis, located beneath the epidermis, is vascularized. The papillary layer is the uppermost layer of the dermis containing capillaries, so a cut reaching this layer will cause bleeding.
Question 5.18: "As you are walking down the beach, you see a dead, dry, shriveled-up fish. Which layer of your epidermis keeps you from drying out?"
Correct Answer: stratum corneum
Explanation: The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, composed of dead, flattened, keratinized cells. This layer, along with the glycolipids between its cells, forms a crucial water barrier, preventing excessive water loss from the body (desiccation).
Question 5.19: "If you cut yourself and bacteria enter the wound, which of the following cells would help get rid of the bacteria?"
Correct Answer: Langerhans cells
Explanation: Langerhans cells are phagocytic immune cells within the epidermis that engulf pathogens (like bacteria) and present antigens to initiate an immune response. Keratinocytes form the physical barrier, melanocytes produce pigment, and Merkel cells are touch receptors. Macrophages in the dermis would also be involved if the cut is deep enough.
Question 5.20: "In general, skin cancers ________."
Correct Answer: can be reduced by limiting exposure to the sun
Explanation: The primary cause of most skin cancers is exposure to UV radiation from the sun or artificial sources (tanning beds). Therefore, limiting sun exposure and using sun protection significantly reduces the risk. While many skin cancers are treatable if caught early, some (like melanoma) can be very dangerous and metast
