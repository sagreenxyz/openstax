Okay, here are the answers and explanations for the Chapter 6 skeletal system questions you provided:

1.  **Question:** Which function of the skeletal system would be especially important if you were in a car accident?
    * **Correct Answer:** protection of internal organs
    * **Explanation:** In a car accident, the force of impact can cause significant trauma. The skeletal system, particularly the skull (protecting the brain) and the rib cage (protecting the heart and lungs), provides crucial protection against injury to vital internal organs. While other functions like movement facilitation and storage are important, protection is paramount in an acute traumatic event like a car crash.

2.  **Question:** Bone tissue can be described as ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** dense, hard connective tissue
    * **Explanation:** Bone is a specialized type of connective tissue. Its extracellular matrix is mineralized (calcified), making it dense and hard, providing support and structure to the body. It is *living* tissue, not dead, and distinct from cartilage, although related. The skeletal system encompasses bone, cartilage, and ligaments.

3.  **Question:** Without red marrow, bones would not be able to ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** make blood cells
    * **Explanation:** Red bone marrow is responsible for hematopoiesis, the process of producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Mineral storage (calcium, phosphate) occurs in the bone matrix itself, and bones act as levers for movement regardless of marrow type.

4.  **Question:** Yellow marrow has been identified as ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** an area of fat storage
    * **Explanation:** Yellow bone marrow consists primarily of adipose (fat) cells. It serves as an energy reserve for the body. Muscle attachment points are on the bone surface (periosteum), the hard portion is the bone matrix, and kyphosis is an abnormal spinal curvature.

5.  **Question:** Which of the following can be found in areas of movement?
    * **Correct Answer:** cartilage
    * **Explanation:** Areas of movement typically involve joints where bones articulate. The ends of bones in synovial joints are covered with articular cartilage, a smooth, slippery tissue that reduces friction and absorbs shock, facilitating movement. Hematopoiesis occurs in red marrow, which may be near joints (in epiphyses) but isn't the tissue *facilitating* movement at the joint surface. Yellow marrow is primarily for fat storage.

6.  **Question:** The skeletal system is made of ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** bones and cartilage
    * **Explanation:** The primary structural components of the skeletal system are bones, which provide the rigid framework, and cartilage, which provides flexible support, connects bones (e.g., ribs to sternum), and covers joint surfaces. Muscles and tendons belong to the muscular system.

7.  **Question:** Most of the bones of the arms and hands are long bones; however, the bones in the wrist are categorized as ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** short bones
    * **Explanation:** The wrist bones (carpals) are roughly cube-shaped and provide stability and support. This shape classification fits the definition of short bones. Flat bones are thin (e.g., skull), sesamoid bones develop in tendons (e.g., patella), and irregular bones have complex shapes (e.g., vertebrae).

8.  **Question:** Sesamoid bones are found embedded in ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** tendons
    * **Explanation:** Sesamoid bones are small, independent bones that develop within tendons where they pass over angular structures, particularly near joints. They protect the tendon from wear and tear and can enhance mechanical leverage. The patella (kneecap) is the largest example.

9.  **Question:** Bones that surround the spinal cord are classified as ________ bones.
    * **Correct Answer:** irregular
    * **Explanation:** The vertebrae, which surround and protect the spinal cord, have complex shapes with various projections for muscle attachment and articulation. They don't fit the categories of long, short, flat, or sesamoid bones, and are therefore classified as irregular bones.

10. **Question:** Which category of bone is among the most numerous in the skeleton?
    * **Correct Answer:** long bone
    * **Explanation:** Long bones include the major bones of the limbs (femur, humerus, radius, ulna, tibia, fibula) as well as the smaller bones of the fingers and toes (metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges). Their sheer number, especially counting the phalanges, makes this category the most numerous.

11. **Question:** Long bones enable body movement by acting as a ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** lever
    * **Explanation:** Muscles attach to long bones via tendons. When muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to pivot around joints (which act as fulcrums). This action creates movement, with the bone functioning as a lever.

12. **Question:** Which of the following occurs in the spongy bone of the epiphysis?
    * **Correct Answer:** hematopoiesis
    * **Explanation:** The epiphyses (ends) of long bones contain spongy (cancellous) bone. The spaces within this spongy bone network are filled with red bone marrow, which is the primary site of blood cell formation (hematopoiesis) in adults.

13. **Question:** The diaphysis contains ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** fat stores
    * **Explanation:** The diaphysis is the shaft of a long bone. Its central cavity is the medullary cavity, which in adults is primarily filled with yellow bone marrow. Yellow marrow is mainly composed of adipose tissue, serving as fat stores. While the *wall* of the diaphysis is compact bone, the question asks what the diaphysis *contains* within its cavity.

14. **Question:** The fibrous membrane covering the outer surface of the bone is the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** periosteum
    * **Explanation:** The periosteum is a dense, fibrous membrane that covers the external surface of bones, except at the articular surfaces (which are covered by cartilage). It contains blood vessels, nerves, and bone-forming cells (osteoblasts). The endosteum lines the inner medullary cavity.

15. **Question:** Which of the following are incapable of undergoing mitosis?
    * **Correct Answer:** osteocytes and osteoclasts
    * **Explanation:** Osteocytes are mature bone cells trapped within the bone matrix; they are terminally differentiated and do not divide. Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption; they form from the fusion of precursor cells (related to macrophages) and do not undergo mitosis themselves. Osteogenic cells are stem cells that divide, and osteoblasts (derived from osteogenic cells) have limited mitotic potential.

16. **Question:** Which cells do not originate from osteogenic cells?
    * **Correct Answer:** osteoclasts
    * **Explanation:** Osteogenic (or osteoprogenitor) cells are mesenchymal stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts, which in turn mature into osteocytes. Osteoclasts, however, originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, belonging to the monocyte/macrophage lineage.

17. **Question:** Which of the following are found in compact bone and cancellous bone?
    * **Correct Answer:** lamellae
    * **Explanation:** Lamellae are layers of bone matrix. In compact bone, they are organized into concentric rings within osteons (Haversian systems) and also as circumferential and interstitial lamellae. In cancellous (spongy) bone, lamellae are arranged along the surfaces of the trabeculae. Lacunae (containing osteocytes) and canaliculi are also found in both, but lamellae represent the layered matrix structure present in both types. Haversian systems and canals are specific to compact bone.

18. **Question:** Which of the following are *only* found in cancellous bone?
    * **Correct Answer:** trabeculae
    * **Explanation:** Trabeculae are the defining structural feature of cancellous (spongy) bone. They form an interconnected network of bone struts and plates, providing strength while reducing weight. Canaliculi, Volkmann's canals (found in compact bone), and calcium salts are not exclusive to cancellous bone.

19. **Question:** The area of a bone where the nutrient foramen passes forms what kind of bone marking?
    * **Correct Answer:** a hole
    * **Explanation:** A foramen is the anatomical term for an opening or hole in a bone, typically allowing passage for blood vessels or nerves. The nutrient foramen is specifically the hole through which the main nutrient artery and vein enter/exit the bone shaft.

20. **Question:** Why is cartilage slow to heal?
    * **Correct Answer:** because it does not have a blood supply
    * **Explanation:** Cartilage is avascular, meaning it lacks its own direct blood supply. Nutrients must reach the chondrocytes (cartilage cells) via diffusion through the dense matrix, and waste products must diffuse out. This slow nutrient exchange limits the metabolic rate and the ability of the tissue to repair itself effectively after injury.

21. **Question:** Why are osteocytes spread out in bone tissue?
    * **Correct Answer:** Formation of osteoid spreads out the osteoblasts that formed the ossification centers.
    * **Explanation:** During bone formation (ossification), osteoblasts secrete the organic matrix (osteoid) around themselves. As they deposit matrix, they become progressively separated from each other. Eventually, they become fully encased within the mineralized matrix and differentiate into osteocytes, resulting in their spread-out arrangement within lacunae.

22. **Question:** In endochondral ossification, what happens to the chondrocytes?
    * **Correct Answer:** They die in the calcified matrix that surrounds them and form the medullary cavity.
    * **Explanation:** In the primary ossification center (usually in the diaphysis), chondrocytes enlarge (hypertrophy) and cause the surrounding cartilage matrix to calcify. This calcification blocks nutrient diffusion, causing the chondrocytes to die and disintegrate. This process leaves behind cavities that blood vessels invade, bringing osteoblasts and osteoclasts, eventually leading to the formation of the medullary cavity and replacement of cartilage with bone.

23. **Question:** Which of the following bones is (are) formed by intramembranous ossification?
    * **Correct Answer:** the flat bones of the cranium
    * **Explanation:** Intramembranous ossification is the process where bone forms directly from mesenchymal connective tissue (without a prior cartilage model). This occurs primarily in the flat bones of the skull, the clavicles, and the mandible. Most other bones, including the femur, metatarsals, and ribs, form via endochondral ossification (replacement of a cartilage model).

24. **Question:** Bones grow in length due to activity in the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** epiphyseal plate
    * **Explanation:** The epiphyseal plate (or growth plate) is a layer of hyaline cartilage located between the epiphysis and diaphysis of a growing long bone. Chondrocytes within the plate proliferate (mitosis) and hypertrophy, increasing the cartilage thickness. This cartilage is then replaced by bone on the diaphyseal side, resulting in the elongation of the bone.

25. **Question:** Bones grow in diameter due to bone formation ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** beneath the periosteum
    * **Explanation:** Bones increase in width or diameter through appositional growth. Osteoblasts located in the inner layer of the periosteum (the membrane covering the outer surface of the bone) deposit new layers of bone matrix onto the external surface, thus thickening the bone.

26. **Question:** Which of the following represents the correct sequence of zones in the epiphyseal plate?
    * **Correct Answer:** calcification, maturation, proliferation, reserved
    * **Explanation:** This option lists the zones in order from the *diaphyseal side* to the *epiphyseal side*. The standard order from the epiphysis towards the diaphysis is: 1. Zone of Reserve Cartilage (anchor), 2. Zone of Proliferation (mitosis), 3. Zone of Maturation/Hypertrophy (cell enlargement), 4. Zone of Calcification (matrix calcifies, chondrocytes die), 5. Zone of Ossification (bone replaces cartilage). Option C reverses this standard order.

27. **Question:** A fracture can be both ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** open and transverse
    * **Explanation:** Fracture classifications are not always mutually exclusive. "Open" (or compound) refers to whether the bone breaks the skin, while "closed" (or simple) means it does not. "Transverse" describes the orientation of the break (perpendicular to the long axis). A bone can certainly have a transverse break *and* pierce the skin, making it both open and transverse. Open and closed are mutually exclusive.

28. **Question:** How can a fractured diaphysis release fat globules into the bloodstream?
    * **Correct Answer:** The yellow marrow in the diaphysis is exposed and damaged.
    * **Explanation:** The medullary cavity within the diaphysis of adult long bones is filled with yellow bone marrow, which is rich in fat (adipose tissue). When the diaphysis fractures, the marrow and its blood vessels can be damaged, allowing fat globules to escape from the adipose cells and enter the ruptured blood vessels, potentially leading to a fat embolism.

29. **Question:** In a compound fracture, ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** broken bone pierces the skin
    * **Explanation:** A compound fracture is the older term for an open fracture. It specifically means that one or both ends of the fractured bone have penetrated the overlying skin, creating an open wound and increasing the risk of infection.

30. **Question:** The internal and external calli are replaced by ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** trabecular bone
    * **Explanation:** During fracture healing, a fibrocartilaginous callus forms first to bridge the gap. Osteoblasts then invade this callus and replace it with woven bone, forming a hard (bony) callus composed primarily of trabecular (spongy) bone. This stabilizes the fracture site. Later, this trabecular bone is remodeled into more organized lamellar (compact and spongy) bone.

31. **Question:** The first type of bone to form during fracture repair is ________ bone.
    * **Correct Answer:** spongy
    * **Explanation:** The initial bony callus that replaces the fibrocartilaginous callus is made of immature woven bone. Woven bone has a haphazard collagen arrangement and structure more akin to spongy (trabecular) bone than dense compact bone. This provides rapid stabilization before being remodeled into stronger lamellar bone.

32. **Question:** Wolff’s law, which describes the effect of mechanical forces in bone modeling/remodeling, would predict that ________
    * **Correct Answer:** a right-handed pitcher will have thicker bones in his right arm compared to his left.
    * **Explanation:** Wolff's law states that bone adapts to the loads placed upon it. Increased stress leads to increased bone density and mass, while disuse leads to bone loss. The repetitive, high stresses involved in pitching would cause the bones in the pitcher's dominant arm to remodel and become thicker and stronger than those in the less-stressed non-throwing arm. Cycling uses both legs, bed rest causes bone loss, and while a callus is thick, remodeling aims to restore normal structure.

33. **Question:** Calcium cannot be absorbed from the small intestine if ________ is lacking.
    * **Correct Answer:** vitamin D
    * **Explanation:** The active form of Vitamin D (calcitriol) is essential for stimulating the synthesis of calcium-binding proteins in the intestinal epithelial cells. These proteins are necessary to transport calcium from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. Without sufficient Vitamin D, calcium absorption is significantly reduced, regardless of dietary intake.

34. **Question:** Which one of the following foods is best for bone health?
    * **Correct Answer:** leafy green vegetables
    * **Explanation:** Leafy green vegetables (like kale, collards, spinach, broccoli) are excellent sources of calcium, Vitamin K, and magnesium – all crucial nutrients for bone formation and maintenance. While liver contains Vitamin D and oranges have Vitamin C (important for collagen), leafy greens offer a better combination of key bone minerals and vitamins.

35. **Question:** Which of the following hormones are responsible for the adolescent growth spurt?
    * **Correct Answer:** estrogen and testosterone
    * **Explanation:** While Growth Hormone (GH) and thyroid hormones are essential for growth throughout childhood, the rapid acceleration of growth during puberty (the growth spurt) is primarily driven by the surge in sex hormones – testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls. These hormones also eventually lead to the closure of the epiphyseal plates, ending longitudinal growth.

36. **Question:** With respect to their direct effects on osseous tissue, which pair of hormones has actions that oppose each other?
    * **Correct Answer:** calcitonin and parathyroid hormone
    * **Explanation:** Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases blood calcium levels primarily by stimulating osteoclast activity, which breaks down bone tissue (resorption) and releases calcium. Calcitonin, released when blood calcium is high, inhibits osteoclast activity, thus reducing bone resorption and helping to lower blood calcium levels. Their actions on bone resorption are directly antagonistic.

37. **Question:** When calcium levels are too high or too low, which body system is primarily affected?
    * **Correct Answer:** nervous system
    * **Explanation:** Calcium ions play a vital role in the function of the nervous system (neurotransmitter release, neuron excitability) and muscles (contraction, including the heart). Both hypocalcemia (low calcium) and hypercalcemia (high calcium) can severely disrupt nerve and muscle function, leading to symptoms ranging from muscle cramps and tetany (low Ca) to lethargy, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmias (high Ca).

38. **Question:** All of the following play a role in calcium homeostasis except
    * **Correct Answer:** thyroxine
    * **Explanation:** Calcium homeostasis (maintaining stable blood calcium levels) is primarily regulated by Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Calcitonin, and Vitamin D (calcitriol). Thyroxine, a thyroid hormone, regulates overall metabolic rate and influences bone growth and development but is not a direct, primary regulator in the minute-to-minute control of blood calcium levels.

39. **Question:** Which of the following is most likely to be released when blood calcium levels are elevated?
    * **Correct Answer:** calcitonin
    * **Explanation:** High blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) stimulate the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland to release calcitonin. Calcitonin acts to lower blood calcium by inhibiting bone resorption by osteoclasts and potentially increasing calcium excretion by the kidneys. PTH is released when calcium is low.
