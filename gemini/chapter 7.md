Okay, I have reviewed the questions, answers, and explanations you provided for Chapter 7 (Axial Skeleton).

All the answers and explanations provided in your list (questions 7 through 26) are **correct** based on standard anatomical knowledge. They accurately describe the components, functions, features, and development of the axial skeleton, including the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage.

Here's a confirmation of each, formatted for clarity:

**7. Question:** Which of the following is part of the axial skeleton?
   * **Correct Answer:** vertebral column
   * **Explanation:** The axial skeleton includes the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage, which form the central axis of the body. (The shoulder, thigh, and foot bones belong to the appendicular skeleton).

**8. Question:** Which of the following is a function of the axial skeleton?
   * **Correct Answer:** supports trunk of body
   * **Explanation:** The axial skeleton provides the central support structure for the body's trunk and also protects vital organs like the brain (skull), spinal cord (vertebral column), and heart/lungs (thoracic cage). (Movement of limbs relates to the appendicular skeleton).

**9. Question:** The axial skeleton ________.
   * **Correct Answer:** forms the vertical axis of the body
   * **Explanation:** The axial skeleton consists of the bones along the central longitudinal axis of the body: skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage. (It contains 80 bones; the appendicular skeleton has 126. It does not include limb bones).

**10. Question:** Which of the following is a bone of the brain case?
    * **Correct Answer:** parietal bone
    * **Explanation:** The brain case (cranium) bones enclose and protect the brain. The parietal bone is a major cranial bone. (Zygomatic, maxillary, and lacrimal bones are facial bones).

**11. Question:** The lambdoid suture joins the parietal bone to the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** occipital bone
    * **Explanation:** The lambdoid suture is the immovable joint (suture) located on the posterior aspect of the skull, connecting the two parietal bones with the occipital bone.

**12. Question:** The middle cranial fossa ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** has the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen spinosum
    * **Explanation:** The middle cranial fossa, a depression in the floor of the cranial cavity, houses the temporal lobes and contains several foramina (openings) primarily within the sphenoid bone, including the foramen rotundum, ovale, and spinosum, which transmit nerves and blood vessels.

**13. Question:** The paranasal sinuses are ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** air-filled spaces found within the frontal, maxilla, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones only
    * **Explanation:** These specific skull bones contain hollow, mucous membrane-lined, air-filled spaces known as the paranasal sinuses. They connect to the nasal cavity, help to lighten the skull, and resonate sound.

**14. Question:** Parts of the sphenoid bone include the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** sella turcica
    * **Explanation:** The sella turcica is a prominent, saddle-shaped depression located on the superior surface of the body of the sphenoid bone, which cradles the pituitary gland. (Glabella is on the frontal bone; squamous portion and zygomatic process are features found on other bones like the temporal bone).

**15. Question:** The bony openings of the skull include the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** hypoglossal canal, which is located in the posterior cranial fossa
    * **Explanation:** The hypoglossal canal is found in the occipital bone at the base of the skull, within the posterior cranial fossa, and transmits the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). (Carotid canal is more central/middle fossa related; superior orbital fissure is posterior orbit; mental foramen is on the mandible).

**16. Question:** The cervical region of the vertebral column consists of ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** seven vertebrae
    * **Explanation:** The neck region of the spine is formed by the first seven vertebrae, designated C1 through C7. (Thoracic has 12, Lumbar has 5, Sacrum is 5 fused).

**17. Question:** The primary curvatures of the vertebral column ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** are remnants of the original fetal curvature
    * **Explanation:** During fetal development, the entire vertebral column has a single C-shaped curve (concave anteriorly). The thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves retain this original fetal curvature and are thus called primary curvatures. (Cervical and lumbar curves develop after birth and are secondary curvatures).

**18. Question:** A typical vertebra has ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** lamina that spans between the transverse process and spinous process
    * **Explanation:** The lamina is one of two flat plates of bone that extend medially from the pedicles to unite and form the posterior midline spinous process. It forms part of the vertebral arch enclosing the vertebral foramen.

**19. Question:** A typical lumbar vertebra has ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** a short, rounded spinous process
    * **Explanation:** Lumbar vertebrae are characterized by their large size (to support body weight) and features adapted for weight-bearing, including short, blunt, posteriorly projecting spinous processes. (Bifid spinous processes and transverse foramina are typical of cervical vertebrae; rib articulations are on thoracic vertebrae).

**20. Question:** Which is found only in the cervical region of the vertebral column?
    * **Correct Answer:** nuchal ligament
    * **Explanation:** The nuchal ligament is a thickened, elastic expansion of the supraspinous ligament specifically in the posterior neck region, extending from C7 to the base of the skull. It helps support the head. (The other listed ligaments extend over larger portions of the vertebral column).

**21. Question:** The sternum ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** has the sternal angle located between the manubrium and body
    * **Explanation:** The sternum (breastbone) consists of three parts: manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The junction between the superior manubrium and the central body forms a palpable prominence called the sternal angle (angle of Louis), which aligns with the second rib.

**22. Question:** The sternal angle is the ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** junction between the manubrium and body
    * **Explanation:** This is the definition of the sternal angle, an important anatomical landmark on the anterior chest wall.

**23. Question:** The tubercle of a rib ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** is for articulation with the transverse process of a thoracic vertebra
    * **Explanation:** Located on the posterior surface of a typical rib near the neck, the tubercle features an articular facet that connects with the corresponding facet on the transverse process of the same-numbered thoracic vertebra, forming the costotransverse joint.

**24. Question:** True ribs are ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** attached via their costal cartilage directly to the sternum
    * **Explanation:** Ribs 1-7 are classified as true ribs (vertebrosternal ribs) because their costal cartilages attach individually and directly to the sternum. (Ribs 8-10 attach indirectly; ribs 11-12 do not attach anteriorly).

**25. Question:** Embryonic development of the axial skeleton involves ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** endochondral ossification, which forms the ribs and sternum
    * **Explanation:** While flat skull bones form via intramembranous ossification, most bones of the axial skeleton below the skull, including the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, develop via endochondral ossification, where bone replaces a pre-existing hyaline cartilage model.

**26. Question:** A fontanelle ________.
    * **Correct Answer:** is the area of fibrous connective tissue found at birth between the brain case bones
    * **Explanation:** Fontanelles ("soft spots") are membrane-filled spaces located where the cranial bones have not yet fully ossified and fused in an infant's skull. They allow the skull to deform during birth and accommodate rapid brain growth.
